corrected bug related to multiple definition of the variables in io.h during make
we included io.h in io.c and simulator.c and we defined variables in io. This was wrong

we fixed the bags:
    i) define variables in io.h
    ii)create simulator.h which contains the externals of the used function in simulator.c

completed step1
program accepts as input a spice file and it stores the nodes of circuit in a hashtable and
all the information of each component into an array
